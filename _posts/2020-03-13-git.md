## Installing Git on MacOS

Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer. 
Even if it’s already installed, it’s probably a good idea to update to the latest version.

There are several ways to install Git on a Mac:

1.	The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run ```git``` from the 
	Terminal the very first time.
	
	```
	git --version
	```
	If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.
2.	Otherwise you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, 
	at [git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
3. 	You can also install it as part of the GitHub for macOS install. Their GUI Git tool has an option to install command line tools as well. 
	You can download that tool from the GitHub for macOS website, at [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
